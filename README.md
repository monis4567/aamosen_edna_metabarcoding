# aamosen_edna_metabarcoding

##### repository for code for bioinformatic analysis of metabarcode eDNA data obtained from next generation sequencing analysis. Analysis will require access to a high performance computing facility for doing reanalysis of the data. The raw sequence data can be obtained from https://sid.erda.dk/share_redirect/CJYoSnBQw1 and uncompressed on a remote server. Reanalysis of the data requires preinstallation of 'DADA2' and R v4.2 and 'sickle-master'.
